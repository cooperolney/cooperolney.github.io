Slugfest Files
- I used the some of the Slugfest code to create a base for the personal portfolio.
- I started off by copying the feed.html file and edited so that it could match my wireframe.
- I kept a similar format with the fixed nav bar on top, and then the section to compose
  a slime was replaced with the profile picture and bio. And then kept the bootstrap cards
  for each section of the page.

In Class Files
- I used the sample_form.html file from class to get a refresher on how to use forms
  and Web3Forms. And based the contact form section from this code.

Example Websites for Inspiration
- I looked up personal portfolio websites on google images and found this one,
  (https://images-wixmp-530a50041672c69d335ba4cf.wixmp.com/templates/image/8cbcfd79df10d5e052cd6bf2ebf3eaa6b5417ea6b0327aaee2ae8c804e0a0b571615215483635.jpg)
  I took some inspiration from this site, like the top and bottom nav bars and the bio section.
- I found this example by looking up dark themed website examples,
  (https://www.wallofportfolios.in/portfolios/abhishek-raj/)
  I took inspiration from this site by using a similar dark theme and orange combination.

Bootstrap Documentation
- In icons section found all of the icons needed and the code to insert them into the page.
  (https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- In customize > color modes, it shows how to use dark mode.
- In content > images I found the img-thumbnail to get the border around the profile picture.
- In utilities > bordars I found the rounded-circle class to get the profile picture to be a circle. 
- In forms > layout I used col-auto to pair with the image so it stays the correct size.
- In layout > gutters I found out how to change gutter spacing.
- In utlities > colors, I found out how to make the text gray with text-secondary.
- In components > dropdowns there is a section on dropup menus.

  This helped me with the top nav bar implementation, as there was an 
  unwanted vertical line prior to adding the media queries.

Other
- Copied the text from my resume and LinkedIn profile to create the bio
  and main sections of the page.
